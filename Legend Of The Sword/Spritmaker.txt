For Legend of the Sword if you still want to make sprites for that too, can you make you own Game Maker File (*.gmk). Make the sprites there and send me that. If you do, then here is my starting mammoth list (will increase one I remember new things) : 

- Items and (This is not all of them.)

 First, I need icons (not *.ico) for shops. They should have a black back and show that item in the middle, with how much it costs underneath. The costs for each item will be listed here. They should also all be 32x32.
	- Bread (Loaf of bread (Cost = 50 (copper)))
	- Beef  (Like a steak (Cost = 90 (copper)))
	- Beer  (Glass of beer (Cost = 30(copper)))
	- Water (Glass or jug of water (Cost = Free(empty space))))
	
	- Rusted Sword (Sword, but rusty, not in scabbard(Cost = 2(silver)))
	- Arrows       (x15, don't make 15, just put a x15 in the picture(Cost = 95(copper)))
	- Creaking Bow (Greenish bow (Cost = 1(silver)))
	- Quater Staff (Long straight stick (Cost = 75(copper)))

	- Leather Armour (Tanish colour, covering most of the upper body, except for arms and head(Cost = 3(silver)))

- Buildings (Barracks info : 
				All barracks and stables have the repective symbol for that faction on it, (sample symbols in a .zip file sent to you e-mail). That's pretty much it)
	- Roman
		- Barracks 	(Tent looking (75x75))
		- Stable   	(Wooden Barn? (85x85))
		- Fort	   	(Small wooden castle (250x250))
		- Archery Range (Long wooden area with archery targets at the end (75x75))
		- House		(Wooden & stone(different sprites, same description from now on)huts that have door, wooden hut has thatch roof, stone has stone(75x75))
		- Farm		(Wooden House with farm field(100x100))
